## Hi there, I'm Kenny 👋

<!--
👨🏻‍💻⚡ I’m a rising sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR) with a minor in Data Science and Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS).

🥼 My professional interests lie in applied AI & ML models, predictive analytics in revenue management, financial engineering, and process optimization & automation.

🧪 My research interest lies in the intersection between Generative AI and Ethics, which I pursue as an undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley Haas School of Business under Professor David Evan Harris, one of the top 100 influential figures in AI by the Business Insider.

👷🏻 I also serve as the Director of Programs & Events for the Berkeley chapter of the Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE), the biggest student organization for IEOR majors on campus.

🇸🇬🇹🇭 Having spent 10+ years abroad, I possess a multicultural flexibility and awareness, as well as strong engineering and analytical acumen. In my free time, you can find me exploring the globe 🌍, hiking scenic trails, and hitting the tennis court 🎾! -->
